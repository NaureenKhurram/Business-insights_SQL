# Business Insights in SQL

# PROJECT OVERVIEW


## CONTEXT


This project examines the business processes of Mint Classic, a well-established company with offices across five countries. The company specializes in selling replicas of classic and vintage cars, along with a range of other products. It aims to streamline operations by closing one of its warehouses while maintaining its sales and services. This project will focus on analysing inventory processes and providing actionable recommendations for reducing or reorganizing inventory.

## TOOLS FOR ANALYSIS

In this project, SQL language was used to query the relational database, employing DML (SELECT) and DDL (CREATE, ALTER, DROP) statements, along with joins, window functions, and common table expressions (CTEs).
The original database scripts were used to reconstruct the database in Db Browser (SQLite).  No changes were made to any tables, primary keys, foreign keys or constraints. Similarly, the original data was transferred successfully to populate the database.


## RESULTS
- It was recommended that the South warehouse be closed down since it houses the least number of products.  Given that the other three warehouses have not reached full capacity, reorganising the inventory will be more viable.
- Another suggestion was to strengthen the marketing department by assigning additional staff to the VP of Marketing. An active marketing team can implement campaigns that have the potential to boost overall company sales.
- It was suggested that the database be updated to include more information regarding inventory acquisition, such as shipping and assembly times, to improve the process of acquiring new stock. Furthermore, assigning a dedicated staff member to oversee inventory management and implementing key performance indicators (KPIs) would better position the company to handle their inventory in the future.
